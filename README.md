### **Capstone Project-1: Discover Art and share yours!**


### Motivation

___

The website lets users discover artists and art that are or were displayed at the MET Museum. The information available can be used as an accurate reference or inspiration for artists. The target demographic are artist, art students, or anyone who is interested in art.


**User flow**

When clicking on the home tab, users can select the department or use the search field to find an art piece. Users can also create a user account to login and post their artwork, or they can view other user’s posts under the ‘posts’ tab. On the bottom of each post, is placed a button with a cart icon and on the top of the image is information about the artwork. Users can use that button to save artwork to their liked cart. The list of their likes is found by clicking the cart-shaped option on the navbar. The number next to the cart icon keeps track of  likes. If users want to reach out to the artist of the post, further info can be found by clicking on the username under the avatar. Next to the posts option on the navbar is displayed the login username. Under that option, users can view their profile, add a post, edit  or delete their profile.  The paintbrush icon on the navbar can also keep track of an art piece that is saved for inspiration. To save an art piece on your inspiration list, first, select a department or use the search bar to look up artwork. Then an icon of paint brush will appear under each piece of art. By clicking the icon, users can add art to their inspiration list. 

The website can be developed further so that artists can sell their work by creating a buyer or seller account. As of right now the project needs major front end work.

Some of the challenges I faced while working on the project is deployment. The challenge is accredited to the server not connecting to a database(Heroku PSQL). Retrieving the information needed from the host API as well as finding a faster way to call multiple APIs.  The project is a work in progress and the main app needs better organization but all the features are functioning. 

**Features include:**

- Signup, login, and logout
- Like and save a post(can be done by clicking the cart and brush icon)
- remove like or saved artwork from the list(found on the navbar under the cart and brush icon)
- Home page
- Search bar and select field (for selecting department)
- User profile edits and deletes.
- Add a post option.
